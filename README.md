# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This daily planner allows you to create a schedule for the current day during the timeframe of 8AM-5PM.

Each timeblock is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

You can enter an 'Event/Activities' in each timeslot and clicked save to save the event.
